/**
 * @author VSW
 * Following are the Major Differences between Scanner and BufferedReader Class in Java
 * 		1) BufferedReader is synchronous while Scanner is not. BufferedReader should be used if we are
 * 			working with multiple threads.
 *
 * 		2) BufferedReader has a significantly larger buffer memory than Scanner.
 *
 * 		3) The Scanner has a little buffer (1KB char buffer) as opposed to the BufferedReader
 * 			(8KB byte buffer), but itâ€™s more than enough.
 *
 * 		4) BufferedReader is a bit faster as compared to scanner because the scanner does the parsing
 * 			of input data and BufferedReader simply reads a sequence of characters.
